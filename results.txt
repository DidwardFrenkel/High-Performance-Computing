Results:

Problem 1:
Latency: 0.000030 s. for 10 procs, N = 1000
Bandwidth: 0.588916 MB/s for 10 procs, N = 50

Problem 2:
All results below were done for 10 Jacobi iterations.
Time elapsed for 2 procs, 1001 partitions: 0.053142 sec.
Time elapsed for 20 procs, 1001 partitions: 0.197091 sec.
Time elapsed for 200 procs, 1001 partitions: 11.880743 sec.
Contrary to claims of independence of p for N large, time seems to increase dramatically for p large.
This may, however, be due to the fact that the program was run on a computer with two processors instead of the Stampede system.
Alternatively, my jacobi_mpi.c may not have been programmed to specifications, despite using mpi commands.

A parallel version of the Gauss-Seidel smoother would be more difficult due to the need to continuously update the given vector during processing.
